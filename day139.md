# Day 139 – September 13, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1**: Finished exercises of Chapter 7 – Heterogeneous Equilibrium (Química Feltre Vol. 2).  
- **Pomodoro 2**: Corrected some exercises from Chapter 7, but didn’t finish all corrections.  

## 💬 Reflection
Didn’t reach 6 pomodoros, but at least pushed chemistry forward. Closing the gap with corrections will set the base for the next chapters.
