# Day 2

**What I did today:**  
Studied Chapter 1 of *Física Clássica Vol.1* (by Caio Calçada & José Luiz Sampaio) - With a lot of effort I managed to complete this chapter, because there were 83 questions, plus the text to read, now just put it down to revise in the future.

**Topic covered:**  
Introduction to Physics — understanding what physics is, its branches, the scientific method, and how models represent reality.

**What I learned today:**  
Physics is not just formulas — it's a way of explaining nature using logic, observation, and experiments. I also realized how important it is to connect theory with physical intuition. I've learned that I mustn't lose focus, that I must keep moving forward and never think that the game is won, it will never end, I must really commit to it.
