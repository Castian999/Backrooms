# Day 3

**What I did today  
Almost finished the “Set Theory” section of *Topics of Elementary Algebra*.

**What I learned today  
Never underestimate a topic just because it seems basic - I faced problems that I couldn't solve today. in parts I feel humiliated, but at least the lesson was learned.
