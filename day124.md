# Day 124 – August 29, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1** → Almost finished exercises of Physics Classical Vol.1, Ch.25 (Fluidostatics).  
- **Pomodoro 2** → Completed Ch.25 (Fluidostatics) and started Ch.26 (Archimedes’ Principle).

## 💬 Reflection
Only two pomodoros, but significant progress: closed out Fluidostatics and stepped into Archimedes’ Principle. Forward momentum maintained.
