# Day 140 – September 14, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1**: Corrected some exercises from Chapter 7 – Heterogeneous Equilibrium (Química Feltre Vol. 2).  
- **Pomodoro 2**: Almost finished corrections for Chapter 7.  

## 💬 Reflection
It wasn’t a strong day, but I still pushed chemistry forward. Nearing the end of Chapter 7 corrections, which will clear the way for the next steps.
