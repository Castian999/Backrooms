# Day 185 – October 29, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

No study sessions completed today due to poor mental health and procrastination.

## 💬 Reflection

My mental state wasn’t in a good place today, and I ended up procrastinating instead of focusing. I recognize this pattern and will work on regaining consistency step by step — even slow progress counts.
