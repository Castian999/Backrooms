# Day 10

**What I did today:**  
- Finished the polynomials section in *Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar*.  
- Started the section on special products (produtos notáveis).  
- Read part of Chapter 2 from *Química Vol.1 (Feltre)* — "Understanding Matter and Its Transformations".

**What I learned today:**  
This math book frustrates me deeply. It makes me feel like giving up. I don’t know if it’s poor didactics or just my own shortcomings — maybe both. But even with those thoughts, I showed up and studied. That has to count for something.

**Pomodoros:**
