# 📅 Day 13 – May 10, 2025

## 📘 What I studied:
- ✅ Finished Chapter 4 (Uniform Motion) from **Física Clássica Vol.1**
- 🚀 Started Chapter 5: *Movimento Uniformemente Variado (MUV)*
- ✅ Completed the *Notable Products* section from **Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar**

## 🧠 What I learned:
Even when I understand a solution after reading it, I often doubt if I’ll manage a similar problem later. But this fear is part of the learning curve — the more I practice, the more confident I’ll become.

## ⏱️ Pomodoros:
- 4 Pomodoros (split between math and physics)
