# Day 184 – October 28, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

No study sessions completed today. The day was spent dealing with unexpected tasks and feeling unwell, which prevented focused study.

## 💬 Reflection

Woke up feeling unwell and had several responsibilities that disrupted the study flow. Though no progress was made today, I’ll treat this as a necessary pause before regaining momentum.
