# Day 193 – November 6, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

- 🧠 Pomodoro 1: Review session using the Feynman Technique.  
- 📘 Pomodoro 2: Corrected several exercises from *Matemática – Volume Único* by Gelson Iezzi, Chapter 18 (Trigonometric Equations and Inequalities).

## 💬 Reflection

Better than yesterday. The focus is coming back little by little.  
Each correction feels like a small step toward mastering the logic behind the formulas.
