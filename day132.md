1. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2 – Chapter 7 (Heterogeneous Equilibria):** Finished reading the theoretical section.  
2. **Chemistry – Exercises:** Nearly completed the exercises for Chapter 7.  

## 💬 Reflection
A clear improvement compared to yesterday. Covered the full theory of heterogeneous equilibria and nearly wrapped up the exercises. Step by step, building momentum again.
