## ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Breakdown

- **Pomodoro 1**: Corrected some exercises from Chapter 1 (Solutions) of *Feltre Vol. 2* (Chemistry).  
- **Pomodoro 2**: Continued correcting chemistry exercises.  
- **Pomodoro 3**: Finished Chapter 1 and started Chapter 2 on *colligative properties* (Chemistry).  
- **Pomodoro 4**: Finished reading Chapter 8 (Progressions) from *Matem√°tica Volume √önico* and started solving exercises.  
- **Pomodoro 5**: Continued working on math exercises (progressions).  
- **Pomodoro 6**: Started a simulated test.

## üí¨ Reflection

Tough but productive. Wrapped up the first chapter of chemistry and dove into colligative properties. Math also moved forward with progressions, and I finally began a simulation session.
