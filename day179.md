# Day 179 – October 23, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Finished Chapter 17 from *Matemática – Volume Único* and started Chapter 18, which covers trigonometric equations and inequalities.

## 💬 Reflection

A solid and steady day. I wrapped up one chapter and moved right into the next — good momentum overall. I just need to keep this consistency and keep building on it.
