## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2, Chapter 5 (Homogeneous Chemical Equilibrium):** Finished reading the theory.  
2. **Chemistry – Ch. 5:** Began solving exercises, but didn’t complete the chapter.  
3. **Chemistry – Ch. 5:** Completed exercises (correction still pending).  
4. **Math – Vol. Único, Chapter 11 (Trigonometry in Right Triangles):** Solved some exercises.  
5. **Math – Ch. 11:** Continued solving exercises.  
6. **Review:** Feynman method.

## 💬 Reflection

Another strong day with 6 pomodoros. Wrapped up the theoretical part of chemical equilibrium and worked through its exercises. Also made progress in trigonometry. Ended with a Feynman review — good balance of theory, exercises, and consolidation.
