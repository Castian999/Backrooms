# Day 129 – September 3, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1** → Started *Feltre Chemistry Vol. 2 – Ch.7 (Homogeneous Equilibrium)*.

## 💬 Reflection
Only managed one pomodoro today, far from the goal of six. Feeling ashamed of the low performance, but showing up still matters. This chapter marks the beginning of a new topic in chemistry, and I’ll aim to pick up the pace tomorrow.
