# Day 9

**What I did today:**  
- Continued solving exercises from Chapter 3 of *Física Clássica Vol.1* (scalar velocity).  
- Read Chapter 2 of *Química Vol.1 (Feltre)* — Matter and its transformations.

**What I learned today:**  
I was distracted during most pomodoros — only one was truly focused. I know I could’ve done more. But showing up, even imperfectly, still matters. Tomorrow, I try again.

**Pomodoros:**  
4 x 50/10 (3 physics, 1 chemistry) — only 1 fully focused
