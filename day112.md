# Day 112 – August 17, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2 – Chapter 4 (Chemical Kinetics):** Finished the chapter.

## 💬 Reflection

Today was a light day, with only one pomodoro completed. At least the chapter on chemical kinetics was wrapped up, but overall performance fell short of expectations. I recognize this and humbly apologize, while reminding myself that consistency matters and tomorrow is another chance to improve.
