## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1** → Almost finished correcting exercises from Chapter 14 (Trigonometric Ratios) – *Matemática Volume Único, Gelson Iezzi*.

## 💬 Reflection
A better day compared to yesterday. Even without hitting 6 pomodoros, I progressed well in math by closing one chapter and starting the next.
