# Day 169 – October 13, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Started Chapter 3 – Calorimetry in *Física Clássica Volume 2*.

## 💬 Reflection

Only managed one pomodoro today — woke up feeling sore and drained from yesterday’s training session. Even so, I pushed myself to begin a new chapter in physics, keeping the momentum alive despite the fatigue.
