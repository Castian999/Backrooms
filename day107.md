# Day 107 – August 12, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Physics – Classical Physics – Chapter 24 (Gravitation):** Finished reading the theoretical section.
2. **Physics – Chapter 24:** Solved some selected exercises.
3. **Physics – Chapter 24:** Completed all selected exercises, pending corrections.

## 💬 Reflection

A day marked by low motivation, but still managed to progress in physics. Finished the theoretical study of gravitation, worked through the selected exercises, and prepared for the correction phase. Fewer pomodoros than planned, but kept the streak alive.
