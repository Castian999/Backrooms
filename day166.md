## ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Finished the exercises for Chapter 2 ‚Äì Thermal Expansion in *F√≠sica Cl√°ssica: Volume 2* and began corrections.  
**Pomodoro 2:** Continued correcting the physics exercises.  
**Pomodoro 3:** Completed Chapter 2 ‚Äì Expansion of Bodies in *F√≠sica Cl√°ssica: Volume 2*.  
**Pomodoro 4:** Started rereading Chapter 8 ‚Äì Electrochemistry in *Qu√≠mica Feltre: Volume 2* for deeper understanding.

## üí¨ Reflection

A productive and balanced day ‚Äî not the full six pomodoros, but still marked by solid progress across both physics and chemistry. The physics section closed nicely, and revisiting electrochemistry brought new clarity to older material.
