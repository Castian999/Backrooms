# Day 40 - June 6, 2025

**Review**  
- 🧠 1 pomodoro using Feynman method

**Mathematics**  
- ➗ 3 pomodoros – almost finished trinômio of the second degree (Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar)

**Physics**  
- ⚙️ 2 pomodoros – continued Chapter 12 (Newton’s Laws), almost finished

**Reflection**  
Not a good day emotionally, but I still showed up and studied. That counts.
