# 📅 Day 21 – May 18, 2025

## 📘 What I studied:
- ⚗️ Chemistry: Continued Chapter 4 (Feltre Vol.1 – Atomic Models), but didn’t finish.
- ➕ Mathematics: Finished exercises on first-degree equations — correction pending.

## ⏱️ Pomodoros:
- 5 total: 3 Chemistry, 2 Math

## 🧠 How I felt:
A rough day — didn’t feel like doing anything. I pushed through, but did things without much focus. Still, the work got done, even if not at my best.
