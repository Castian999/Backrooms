# Day 143 – September 17, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
1. **Physics – Classical Physics Vol. 1:** Started writing a review of the completed book.  
2. **Physics – Review Writing:** Finished the review, with the intention of turning it into a video.

## 💬 Reflection
A more productive day than yesterday. Writing the review helped me reflect on everything I learned from *Classical Physics Vol. 1*, and it also opened the door to creating content around it.
