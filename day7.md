# Day 7

**What I did today:**  
Started studying *Química Vol.1* by Ricardo Feltre. Completed Chapter 1 and began Chapter 2.

**What I learned today:**  
Starting a new subject felt refreshing. Even though I didn’t finish Chapter 2, I’m beginning to connect chemistry with the bigger picture of science. One step at a time.
