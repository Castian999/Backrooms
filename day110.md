## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

No study sessions completed today. Took the day off.

## 💬 Reflection

I didn’t study today. After several intense sessions, I decided to allow myself a pause to recover energy and clear my mind. Rest days are also part of the journey — they help sustain consistency in the long run.
