# Day 159 – October 3, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Physics – Classical Physics Vol. 2 – Chapter 1 (Thermometry):** Finished the chapter and started Chapter 2 on Thermal Expansion.  
2. **Physics – Chapter 2 (Thermal Expansion):** Completed the theoretical reading.  
3. **Physics – Chapter 2 (Thermal Expansion):** Began solving the selected exercises.  
4. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2 – Chapter 8 (Electrochemistry):** Read part of the theoretical section.

## 💬 Reflection

A solid recovery after a rough day. Physics saw good progress — finishing Thermometry and diving into Thermal Expansion — and chemistry continued advancing through electrochemistry theory.
