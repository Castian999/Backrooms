# Day 8

**What I did today:**  
- Continued *Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar*: Finished the module section, started the polynomials chapter.  
- Worked on problems from Chapter 3 of *Física Clássica Vol.1* (scalar velocity).

**What I learned today:**  
I realized I forgot a lot about modules, which made me feel useless — but that just shows what needs to be strengthened. Progress isn't always pretty, but it's still progress.

**Pomodoros:**  
4 x 50/10 (3 math, 1 physics)
