# Day 117 – August 22, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Physics – Classical Physics Vol. 1, Chapter 25 (Fluid Statics):** Solved some exercises.  
2. **Physics – Ch. 25:** Continued with exercises.  
3. **Physics – Ch. 25:** Completed exercises (correction still pending).  
4. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2, Chapter 5 (Homogeneous Chemical Equilibrium):** Corrected some exercises.  

## 💬 Reflection

A less productive day compared to the last three, but still steady progress. Finished all the exercises for fluid statics and advanced in correcting chemistry. Corrections remain pending, but the chapter closures are stacking up.
