# Day 186 – October 30, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Worked on several exercises from Chapter 18 – *Trigonometric Equations and Inequalities* of *Matemática: Volume Único* by Gelson Iezzi.  
**Pomodoro 2:** Completed the remaining exercises from Chapter 18, though corrections are still pending.

## 💬 Reflection

A clear improvement compared to yesterday. I managed to rebuild some momentum and make tangible progress in math. Even small steps forward mean I’m getting back on track — consistency is returning bit by bit.
