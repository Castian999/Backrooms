No study sessions completed today.

## 💬 Reflection

Today was mentally heavy. I spent most of the day troubleshooting and reorganizing my study materials — after realizing several of my notes had inconsistencies between different subjects. What started as a quick fix turned into hours of trying to reformat and cross-check everything. By the time I was done, my focus was gone. I’ll pick things up properly tomorrow with a clearer structure.
