# Day 114 – August 19, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Review:** Feynman method session.  
2. **Physics – Gravitation (Ch. 24, Classical Physics):** Nearly finished corrections.  
3. **Physics – Gravitation (Ch. 24):** Fully completed the chapter.  
4. **Physics – Chapter 25 (Fluid Statics):** Started the new chapter.  
5. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2 – Chapter 5 (Homogeneous Chemical Equilibrium):** Began reading.  
6. **Chemistry – Ch. 5:** Nearly finished reading the theory.

## 💬 Reflection

A very productive day — hit all 6 pomodoros. Closed the book on gravitation, opened fluid statics, and dove into chemical equilibrium. Balanced progress across physics and chemistry while still fitting in a review session.
