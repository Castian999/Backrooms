# Day 42 - June 8, 2025

**Chemistry**  
- ⚗️ 3 pomodoros – worked through exercises on inorganic oxides (Chapter 9)

**Mathematics**  
- ➗ 3 pomodoros – finished trinomials of the second degree (Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar)

**Reflection**  
Not the best day emotionally, but I stayed on track and made progress. That’s what counts.
