# Day 188 – November 1, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

- **Pomodoro 1:** Finished the exercises from Chapter 9 – *Electrolysis* in *Química Feltre Volume 2* and started correcting them.

## 💬 Reflection

A small but meaningful improvement compared to yesterday. I managed to focus and make progress in chemistry. One pomodoro may seem little, but it’s a sign of recovery — the important thing is to keep moving forward.
