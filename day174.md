# Day 174 – October 18, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Corrected some exercises from Chapter 8 – *Electrochemistry* (Feltre, Chemistry Vol. 2).  
**Pomodoro 2:** Almost finished correcting the remaining exercises from Chapter 8.  
**Pomodoro 3:** Finished Chapter 8 and started Chapter 9 – *Electrolysis*.  

## 💬 Reflection

A solid recovery from yesterday. I managed to get back into rhythm and made good progress in chemistry — especially understanding electrochemical processes and starting electrolysis.
