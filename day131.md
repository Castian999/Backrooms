# Day 131 – September 5, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
1. **Physics – Classical Physics Vol. 1 – Chapter 26 (Archimedes' Principle):** Completed the exercises, corrections still pending.

## 💬 Reflection
Only one pomodoro today, but I managed to finish the exercises for Chapter 26 in physics. Even on low-energy days, each bit of progress matters.
