# 📅 Day 16 – May 13, 2025

## 📘 What I studied:
- ⚙️ Physics: Continued working on the long exercise list from Chapter 5 (MUV) – almost finished.
  - Faced a “simple” ITA question I had seen before but still couldn’t solve — frustrating.
- ⚗️ Chemistry: Finished reading Chapter 3 (Feltre Vol.1 – Lavoisier, Proust, Dalton) and started exercises.

## ⏱️ Pomodoros:
- 5 total: 3 Physics, 2 Chemistry

## 🧠 How I felt:
The day was long and tiring — felt like I didn’t produce much. Frustrated at some mistakes, but still moving forward.
