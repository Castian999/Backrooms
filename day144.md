# Day 144 – September 18, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- No study pomodoros today due to exhaustion and other tasks demanding my time.

## 💬 Reflection
It was an exhausting day filled with non-study responsibilities. No progress in my books, but still showing up to log the journey. Tomorrow, I’ll aim to pick up the pace again.
