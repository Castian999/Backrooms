# Day 209 – November 22, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

- 📘 Pomodoro 1: Finished reading the theoretical section of Chapter 19 (Matrices) from *Matemática – Volume Único* and began the selected exercises.  
- ✏️ Pomodoro 2: Solved additional exercises from Chapter 19.  
- ⚗️ Pomodoro 3: Corrected several exercises from Chapter 9 of *Química – Volume 2 (Feltre)* and realized how challenging electrochemistry still feels.

## 💬 Reflection

Better than yesterday — definitely a recovery step.  
Electrochemistry is proving tough, but acknowledging the difficulty is the first move toward mastering it.  
Let’s see if tomorrow becomes a full 6-pomodoro day.
