# Day 175 – October 19, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Began reading the theoretical section of Chapter 9 – *Electrolysis* (Feltre, Chemistry Vol. 2).  

## 💬 Reflection

It wasn’t a very productive day. Energy felt low, and progress was minimal, but at least the study streak continued. Even a small step keeps the momentum alive — what matters is not stopping completely.
