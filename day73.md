- Focused on key exercises while applying a new personal method for problem sets:
  - 📌 **"Selected Practice Method"**:
    - Chapters with **≤25** exercises → Do **10** selected questions.
    - Chapters with **26–40** exercises → Do **15** selected questions.
    - Chapters with **>40** exercises → Do **20–25** selected questions.
- Completed 3 Pomodoros following this method.

## 🧪 Chemistry

- Chemistry: 1
- Review: 1

## 💬 Reflection
Today marked a critical turning point. I realized perfectionism was slowing me down and exhausting me. With the new “Selected Practice Method,” I can now maintain focus, avoid burnout, and still extract the maximum learning. This new path feels more sustainable and effective.
