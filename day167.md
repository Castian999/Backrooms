# Day 167 – October 11, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

**Pomodoro 1:** Continued reading Chapter 8 – Electrochemistry in *Química Feltre: Volume 2*.  
**Pomodoro 2:** Kept reading the same chapter — it’s extensive and dense with concepts.

## 💬 Reflection

A steady day of progress. The electrochemistry chapter is long and theory-heavy, but I stayed consistent. Even without major breakthroughs, every page adds up toward mastery.
