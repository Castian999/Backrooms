## ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Math ‚Äì Vol. √önico, Chapter 11 (Trigonometry in Right Triangles):** Solved some exercises.  
2. **Math ‚Äì Ch. 11:** Continued exercises and completed them (correction still pending).  
3. **Math ‚Äì Ch. 11:** Began corrections but didn‚Äôt finish.  
4. **Physics ‚Äì Classical Physics Vol. 1, Chapter 25 (Fluid Statics):** Finished reading the theory.  
5. **Physics ‚Äì Ch. 25:** Solved some exercises, not all completed yet.  
6. **Review:** Feynman method.

## üí¨ Reflection

Another day with 6 pomodoros. Wrapped up the theoretical part of fluid statics and made good progress in math with trigonometry exercises. Still pending corrections in both math and physics, but the pace is steady and strong.
