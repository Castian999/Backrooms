# Day 113 – August 18, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Mathematics – Volume Único – Chapter 10 (Similarity of Triangles):** Solved some exercises.
2. **Mathematics – Corrections:** Began correcting exercises from Chapter 10.
3. **Mathematics – Conclusion & New Chapter:** Finished Chapter 10 and started Chapter 11 on trigonometry in right triangles.

## 💬 Reflection

A “more or less” day, but progress was made: exercises and corrections on similarity of triangles were wrapped up, and the journey into trigonometry began. Even if not a full workload, closing a chapter always feels rewarding.
