# Day 71 – July 7, 2025

## 🔄 Strategy Shift – Math

Today was not a day of traditional study, but one of **reflection and strategic redirection**. After evaluating my current struggles with *Tópicos de Álgebra Elementar*, I’ve decided to **temporarily pause** that book.

### 🧠 New Math Plan:
- 📘 Start **Volume Único de Matemática (Gelson Iezzi)** to strengthen my fundamentals.
- 🧪 In parallel, solve all **OBMEP Phase 1 & 2 exams from 2005 to 2025** (total: 42 tests).
- 📚 Then move to **Fundamentos da Matemática Elementar Vol. 1** to deepen understanding.
- 🔁 Eventually return to *Tópicos* fully prepared to conquer it.

This decision wasn’t easy, but it’s necessary for long-term mastery. A step back to gain momentum.

## 💬 Reflection
No pomodoros today — just planning and resetting my compass. I know where I’m going, and now I know the best path to get there.
