# Backrooms
Here are my self-taught projects, combined with the process of gamifying learning with the aesthetics of backrooms.
---
## **Project overview**

**Goal:**
Survive and master the foundations of physics, chemistry and mathematics while traversing the unknow levels of knowledge backrooms.

**context:**
Each book, each project represent a level in backrooms - an infinite, silent labyrinth filled with cognitive traps and scientific treasures.
---
## **Level Structure**
- **Level 0:**
Nine books for the base - F√≠sica cl√°ssica volume 1 (authors Caio S√©rgio Cal√ßada (Autor), Jos√© Luiz Sampaio (Autor)), F√≠sica cl√°ssica volume 2 (authors Caio S√©rgio Cal√ßada (Autor), Jos√© Luiz Sampaio (Autor)), F√≠sica cl√°ssica volume 3 (authors Caio S√©rgio Cal√ßada (Autor), Jos√© Luiz Sampaio (Autor)), Qu√≠mica 1 (author Ricardo Feltre), Qu√≠mica 2 (author Ricardo Feltre), Qu√≠mica 3 (author Ricardo Feltre), T√≥picos de √ÅLGEBRA ELEMENTAR (authors Bruno Pedra, Alex Ricardo, Ivan Monteiro), 1000 Quest√µes de Matem√°tica (author Julianelli Et Al), Fundamentos de matem√°tica elementar - Volume 1: Conjuntos e fun√ß√µes (Authors Gelson Iezzi (Autor), Carlos Murakami (Autor)).

## **Study Methodology**

- **Pomodoro Technique**: 50 minutes study / 10 minutes break.
- **5 Review Cycles**: 
  - Review each chapter after 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days.
- **Feynman Technique**: 
  - After reading each chapter, explain it to yourself in simple terms, as if teaching a beginner.

##  **Gamification Rules**

- Each completed level unlocks new challenges.
- Progress is tracked openly (through GitHub commits and Twitter posts).
- The final goal: Build a unique intellectual identity based on ultra-consistency.
