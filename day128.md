# Day 128 – September 20, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown
- **Pomodoro 1** → Finished reading the theory of *Physics – Classical Mechanics Vol. 1, Ch.26 (Archimedes’ Principle)*.  
- **Pomodoro 2** → Solved some exercises from Ch.26 (Archimedes’ Principle).  

## 💬 Reflection
Still not back to 6 pomodoros, but progress was made. Advanced through the theory and began tackling exercises in Archimedes’ Principle — one step closer to consolidating physics knowledge.
