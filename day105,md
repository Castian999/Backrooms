# Day 105 – August 10, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

No study sessions completed today.  
Reason: Father's Day – the day was spent with family and in household commitments.

## 💬 Reflection

Today was dedicated to family. While I feel some shame for not studying, it’s important to recognize that rest and relationships are part of the journey too. Tomorrow, the focus returns to the grind.
