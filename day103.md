# Day 103 – August 8, 2025

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Chemistry – Feltre Vol. 2 – Chapter 3 (Thermometry):** Started the chapter.
2. **Chemistry – Theory Reading:** Began reading the theoretical section.
3. **Chemistry – Theory Completed:** Finished the theory and started solving exercises.
4. **Physics – Classical Physics Vol. 1 – Chapter 23 (Statics of Rigid Bodies):** Corrected some exercises.
5. **Physics – Completed Chapter 23:** Finished it and began Chapter 24 (Gravitation).
6. **Review Session:** Used the Feynman method to reinforce concepts.

## 💬 Reflection

It was a productive and solid study day. Chemistry progressed into thermometry, while physics wrapped up statics and moved into gravitation. Ended the day with a Feynman-style review to strengthen understanding.  
Hoping to keep this momentum going in the next days.
