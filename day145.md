## ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Breakdown

1. **Physics Review (Portuguese):** Began production of the review video for *F√≠sica Cl√°ssica Vol. 1*.
2. **Physics Review Completed:** Finalized and posted the review video in Portuguese.
3. **Physics Review (English):** Started writing the English version of the review.
4. **Chemistry Review (Feltre Vol. 1):** Began producing the review video for *Feltre Chemistry Vol. 1*.
5. **Chemistry Review Continued:** Progressed further in producing the chemistry review video.
6. **Review Session:** Applied the Feynman method to reinforce concepts.

## üí¨ Reflection

Today felt like a breakthrough ‚Äî 6 full pomodoros after a tough stretch. Balanced both content creation and study reinforcement. Physics and chemistry reviews are moving forward, and I‚Äôm happy to finally post the first video. Momentum is coming back strong.
